# FixRobinhoodUSDC

The `FixRobinhoodUSDC` initiative is aimed at addressing the issue where users' USDC.e tokens are stuck in Robinhood's system due to a lack of clear communication during the transition from USDC.e support to a new USDC. This repository contains all the necessary information, front-end code, analysis scripts, and transaction generation tools that could be used by Robinhood to resolve the situation and return the assets to their rightful owners.

## Repository Contents

### Front-end Application
The front-end portion of the repository features a SvelteKit application designed to provide an interface for:

- Displaying the overall impact of the issue, including the total number of affected users and the total value held.
- Offering downloadable resources for affected users.
- Linking to additional support and resources on GitHub.

### Analysis Scripts
Contained within this repository are the scripts used to:

- Identify affected users by analyzing on-chain data.
- Calculate the total value of USDC.e tokens that have not been credited to users' accounts.

### Transaction Generation Tools
Also included are tools to:

- Generate unsigned transactions which, if signed by Robinhood, would facilitate the return of USDC.e tokens to the original senders.
- Outline the minimal cost and steps required for Robinhood to execute these transactions, thereby resolving the issue at hand.
